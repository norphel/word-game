# word-game

Word Game is a clone of the famous game **Wordle**.

It was an exercise to practice basic React skills such as:

- useState()
- conditional rendering
- rendering lists of elements
- mutating complex states such as arrays and objects
- lifting state up

#### TODOs

- add visual keyboard like in the original game
- add restart button
